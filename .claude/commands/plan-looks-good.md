This plan looks good! Think harder about how you can break this into well defined tasks that you can delegate to subagents using the Task tool.

Make sure tasks are discrete and well defined. Clearly tell the agents all the files they will need to edit or create. Make sure they have all the context about the project and how all the pieces fit together so that they can do their best work without having to guess or make architectural decisions themselves. Make sure agents do not do more than their defined Task work.

Make sure to also include step(s) utilizing another subagent(s) to verify and validate and test all the work done by Task agents. Make sure 100% of the work way completed, scope was not missed or over shot, and there are no bugs. Do a full code review from multiple angles and perspectives to catch any bugs, bad code, and missing pieces, security issues, and other issues.
